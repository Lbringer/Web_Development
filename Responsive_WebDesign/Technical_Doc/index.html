                    <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series
                        of
                        elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a
                        certain way, or act a certain way.</p>
                    <p>The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to
                        somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For
                        example,
                        take the following line of content: My cat is very grumpy</p>
                </div>
                <div class="code">
                    <div class="code-data">"p tag"My cat is very grumpy"/p tag"</div>

                <ul>
                    <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening
                        and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in
                        this case where the paragraph begins. </li>
                    <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash
                        before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph
                        ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to
                        strange results.</li>

                    <p>We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive

                    <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately
                        changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the
                        page, you should see something like this in place of the image:</li>

                    <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or
                        subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an
                        HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels,
                        h1–h6, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:</p>
